    "summary": "Article One: This is a democratic nation with a functioning legislative branch,which is Congress, complete with a Senate and House of Representatives, and what they do. Said members must be 25-year-old age at minimum, and that the people will democratically elect the members for two years each. The members of the House are divided among the states proportionally, to give more populous states more representatives in the House. The leader of the House is the Speaker of the House, chosen by the members. This article also defines the rules of  Senate, the second body of legislature. Again, it establishes some minimum requirements, such as a 30-year-old age minimum to be a Senator. Senators serve for six years each. Each state has two Senators each - regardless of the population. This Section introduces the Vice-President, who is the leader of the Senate (called the President of the Senate) and that the Vice-President does not vote unless there is a tie. We will not have royalty. States must act as a nation bonded, not as individuals. ",

Says that  members of Congress will be paid, that they cannot be detained while traveling to and from Congress, and that they cannot hold any other office in the government while in the Congress.  Section seven details how bills become law. First, any bill for raising money (such as by taxes or fees) must start out in the House. All bills must pass both houses of Congress in the exact same form. Bills that pass both houses are sent to the President. He can either sign the bill, in which case it becomes law, or he can veto it. In the case of a veto, the bill is sent back to Congress, and if both houses pass it by a two-thirds majority, the bill becomes law over the President's veto. This is known as overriding a veto.  Says Congress has the power to establish and maintain an army and navy, to establish post offices, to create courts, to regulate commerce between the states, to declare war, and to raise money.  No law can give preference to one state over another; no money can be taken from the treasury except by duly passed law, and no title of nobility, such as Prince or Marquis, will ever be established by the government of the United States ! States cannot make their own money, declare war, or do most of the other things prohibited Congress in Section 9. They cannot tax goods from other states, nor can they have navies.",
